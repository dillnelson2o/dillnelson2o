- 👋 Hi, I’m @dillnelson2o, I am PhD student at SDstate. I was born and raised in Pine Ridge Indian Reservation which you can wikipedia for my information. I am only 
starting to learn about plant molecular biology wetlab techniques and bioinformatics even though it is my second year into my PhD program, my undergrad was in unrelated 
feilds. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to program to make bioinformatics pipeline a little more effecient instead of just using command line tools to hammer and chisel
away at a problem from start to finish.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning genome mapping, qtl analysis, rna-seq, genome annotation and medicinal plant molecular/chemical processes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who wants to build draft genomes for medicinal plants used by Native Americans.
- 📫 How to reach me.
